# Mini Project Cafe CLI 
- A simple CLI application to track customer orders in a busy cafe.
## Project Background
- My client has launched a pop-up café in a busy business district. They are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to log and track orders

## Client requirements
The client has given me these requirements for the app. 

- I want to maintain a collection of products and couriers.

- When a customer makes a new order, I need to create this on the
  system.

- I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e: preparing,
  out-for-delivery, delivered.

- When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.

- When I start my app, I need to load all persisted data.

- I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.

- I need to receive regular software updates

## Current Features
- Data persistence using SQlite3
- Unit and integration testing with pytest
- Implemented CRUD operations
• Create
• Read
• Update
• Delete

## project design

## Meeting project requirements
- I used pytest to ensure core functionality
